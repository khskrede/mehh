\section*{PyPy collaboration project}
The PyPy project is an effort to create an implementation of 
the Python language in Python itself, in order to enable various 
forms of translation and optimization, among other things. This 
student project will involve cooperation with the PyPy team, 
solving some of the challenging problems involved in developing 
this technology.

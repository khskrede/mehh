% TODO ! Write a lot about our failures !!!

\begin{itemize}

\item Drop the use of External-Core. Use the GHC API to compile Haskell programs
into JSCore (or something similar). The difficult part will be how to compile
multiple Haskell source files. And figuring out how to get information from the
current buildsystems into our program. This information includes:

\begin{itemize}

\item Language extensions
\item Dependencies
\item Packages
\item And any other information necessary to build the program.

\end{itemize}

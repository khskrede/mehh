\section*{Abstract}

PyPy is a project that implements Virtual Machines in a proper subset of
the Python language called RPython. Virtual Machines written in RPython
can be translated into efficient C code. An interpreter for a lambda-calculus inspired by
Haskell has been written in this language.
This project aims to extend this interpreter to use GHC as a front-end for
a full Haskell JIT compiler. Effectively investigating the feasibility
of applying the JIT compilation techniques of the PyPy project on functional
languages like Haskell.

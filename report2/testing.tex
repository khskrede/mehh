\subsection{Current testing of interpreter}

The current testing used on the project is done by a python-script that performs
the following actions:

\begin{itemize}

\item For all folders in folder 'test':

\begin{itemize}

\item Compile haskell program with GHC and dumping to external-core

\item Run the core2js program on resulting external-core file

\item Run the main interpreter on the JSCore file.

\end{itemize}

\item Dump return-values of programs.

\end{itemize}

Our testing should be extended by checking if the output is correct.


\subsection{GHC test suit}

GHC uses a testsuit. Getting the interpreter to pass these tests are the
ultimate goal, however, the project is not there yet.

\chapter*{Preface}

\section*{Acknowledgements}

I would like to thank the following people;

\begin{itemize}

\item My supervisor, Magnus Lie Hetland, for all his help.

\item Carl Friedrich Bolz, for his help on both the technical parts
of the project, and on the formulation of this report.

\item Even Wiik Thomassen, for his help and hard work.

\item My friends and family for their support during these years of study.

\end{itemize}


\section*{Disclaimer}

This is a collaboration project. Two people are working on this
project at the same time; me, and Even Wiik Thomassen. Since I am working
on my master thesis and he is working on his project thesis, we 
write separate reports. We attempt to present our work in such a way that
it is clear who has done what. Some parts may however look similar,
especially the introduction and background parts, as they are based on 
some of the same papers.

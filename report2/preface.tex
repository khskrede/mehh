\section*{Preface}

This is a collaboration project. Two people are working on this
project at the same time; me, and Even Wiik Thomassen. Since I am working
on my masters thesis and he is working on his specialization project, we 
write separate reports. We attempt to present our work in such a way that
it is clear who has done what. Some parts may however look similar,
especially the introduction and background parts, as they are based on 
some of the same papers.

Changed in version 0.6.3:
   * #111: Correct width calculations when the prompt contains newlines.

   * #109: Add function completeWordWithPrev.

   * #101, #44: Extend the API with Behaviors, which control the choice between
     terminal-style and file-style interaction.

   * #78: Correct width calculations for escape sequences ("\ESC...\STX")

   * Better warning message when -fterminfo doesn't work.

   * Added getPassword as a new input function.

Changed in version 0.6.2.4:
   * Added back a MonadException instance for mtl's StateT.

Changed in version 0.6.2.3:
   * #110: Recognize the enter key in xterm.

   * #108: Fix behavior after a paste of long, non-ASCII text.

   * #106: Ignore input immediately following an unrecognized control sequence.

   * #104: In vi-mode, allow, e.g., "d2w" as well as "2dw"

   * #103: Fix vi-mode 'c' command with movements.

   * #81: Correctly handle characters with a width > 1.

   * Compatibility updates from the GHC folks for Solaris and for ghc-6.14.

   * Optimization: if several key presses are input all at once (e.g. from a
     paste), only display the last change.  This can also make Haskeline more
     responsive when editing long lines.

   * Hard-code some defaults for ctrl-left and ctrl-right, and provide the
     corresponding Emacs bindings to skip words.

Changed in version 0.6.2.2:
   * Raise dependency to utf8-string>=0.3.6 (fixes a bug when decoding invalid
     input)

Changed in version 0.6.2.1:
  Internal/API changes:
   * Make sure to always use binary mode when expecting Char-as-byte.

   * Eliminate unused import warnings on ghc>=6.11

   * Increase upper bound on some dependencies for ghc-6.12

Changed in version 0.6.2:

  User interface changes:
   * A multitude of new emacs and vi commands

   * New preference 'historyDuplicates' to prevent storage of duplicate lines

   * Support PageUp and PageDown keys

   * Let ctrl-L (clear-screen) work during getInputChar

  Internal/API changes:
   * Compatibility with ghc-6.12

   * Calculate the correct width for Unicode combining characters

   * Removed RankNTypes requirement; added Rank2Types and UndecidableInstances

   * Use simpleUserHooks instead of autoconfUserHooks in the Setup script

   * Internal refactoring to make command declaration more flexible

   * Read the .haskeline file completely before starting the UI (laziness issue)

A time and space-efficient implementation of byte vectors using
packed Word8 arrays, suitable for high performance use, both in terms
of large data quantities, or high speed requirements. Byte vectors
are encoded as strict 'Word8' arrays of bytes, and lazy lists of
strict chunks, held in a 'ForeignPtr', and can be passed between C
and Haskell with little effort.

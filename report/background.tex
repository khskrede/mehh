\subsection{PyPy}

\subsubsection{A quick overview}

The PyPy project is basically two things:

\begin{enumerate}
\item the RPython toolchain, written in Python, is a set of compiler tools for 
programs written in RPython.
\item and an implementation of Python using these tools.
\end{enumerate}

In this paper PyPy refers to former.

The basic concept of PyPy is to use a high-level language to allow for rapid
development of interpreters for a variety of platforms. By implementing a compiler
for RPython, interpreters for other languages can be written in RPython and 
compiled to any platform supported by the PyPy toolchain. Supported platforms include
CLI and JVM. \cite{ancona2007rpython} 

\subsubsection{RPython}

RPython is a restricted proper subset of Python, this enables easy analyzis 
as well as efficient compilation. This also means that RPython code can be
run and debugged by Python interpreters, like CPython.

\subsubsection{Just-in-time compilation}

The JIT compiler is the reason why PyPy is able to compete with other language implementations
on speed. Or rather, it's meta-tracing JIT. The JIT is implemented
for RPython, but through a set of compiler hints, it is able to trace the 
execution of the application interpreted by the RPython program.

An introduction to virtual machine (VM) construction with python \cite{pypy}.

\subsubsection{Haskell-Python}

Haskell-Python is an interpreter for a subset of the Haskell language, called Core'.
We call it Core' here because it does not directly correspond to the Core language
used by GHC (the glasgow haskell compiler). Haskell-Python is written in RPython,
and is compiled into a JIT compiler using the RPython toolchain. Our goal for this
project is to start extending Haskell-Python to use GHC as a frontend for compilation 
of Haskell programs.

\subsection{GHC}

\emph{Haskell} is a \emph{strongly-typed non-strict purely-functional} programming language, it will not be
described in detail here, since Haskell is not the language we focus on. See \cite{hudak1992report}
for an introduction to Haskell. 

Core is an intermediate language used by the Glasgow Haskell Compiler\cite{ghc},
and it is this language we wish to interpret. Core is a desugared version of Haskell, things like pattern matching
and list comprehensions are transformed out to simpler constructs.\cite{jones1994compilation}

\subsection{Extcore}

\subsubsection{Compilation by transformation}

GHC uses a compilation idiom called \emph{compilation by transformation}. The idea is to repeatedly perform 
correctness-preserving transformations to the program. Ideally, these transformations will result
in a semantically equal program that executes more quickly or in less space. Such transformations seem
to fall into two categories:

\begin{itemize} 
\item{\emph{Glamorous transformations}} are global, sophisticated, intellectually satisfying transformations,
sometimes guided by some interesting kind of analyzis.
\item{\emph{Humble transformations}} are small, simple, local transformations. Individually they look very trivial.
\end{itemize}

In the Glasgow Haskell Compiler, all humble transformations are done by the \emph{simplifier}. 
\cite{jones1994compilation} The simplifier repeatedly performs transformations on the Core language.


\subsection{Extcore}

Extcore is a package for working with the external-core format.

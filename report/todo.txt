NOTES FROM EVEN:

(06:11:30 PM) Even: 
Jepp, fikk kompilert nå

(06:47:58 PM) Even: 
"Some people seem to think that there is little to gain from using JIT compilation of statically typed

languages since they can be so heavily optimized at compile time. However, a JIT compiler has a lot

more information to work with."

(06:48:38 PM) Even: 
Virker som punch-linen mangler

(06:48:55 PM) Even: 
Eller, kanskje jeg leser det feil

(06:50:49 PM) Even: 
Burde kanskje også forklare hva en meta-tracing JIT er, tror "Runtime Feedback in a Meta-Tracing

JIT for Efficient Dynamic Languages" forklarer det i introduksjoen sin, så du kan referere den

(06:52:02 PM) khs:
